Description: Transpose chunks of an image array to create a scrambled image and
    compute cross-similarity of corresponding chunks from scrambled and 
    original.  Scrambling and cross-similarity functions are each written in 
    both pure R and Rcpp-enabled C++ to allow benchmark comparisons.
